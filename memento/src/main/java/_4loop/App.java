/**
 * Memento Pattern Demonstration Application
 * 
 * The Memento Pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that
 * the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation.
 * This pattern is useful when you need to provide undo functionality, checkpoint
 * systems, or state rollback mechanisms.
 * 
 * Key Components demonstrated:
 * - Originator: Object whose state needs to be saved and restored (Message)
 * - Memento: Stores internal state of Originator (MessageMemento)
 * - Caretaker: Manages mementos but doesn't examine their contents (Caretaker)
 * 
 * This example demonstrates:
 * - Text editor functionality with undo capability
 * - State preservation without exposing internal object structure
 * - Caretaker managing state history without knowing state details
 * - Restoration to previous states while maintaining encapsulation
